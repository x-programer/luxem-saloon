            <h2>1. Introduction & Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to <strong>Saloon Book</strong> (the "Platform", "we", "us", or "our"), an online technology platform that enables users ("you", "User", "Customer") to discover, book, and pay for beauty, wellness, and salon services provided by independent salons, spas, stylists, and service providers ("Vendors", "Salons", "Service Providers").
            </p>
            <p>
                These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our website, mobile application, and related services (collectively, the "Services"). By accessing, registering, or using the Services in any manner, you agree to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy (incorporated herein by reference), and any additional guidelines or rules posted on the Platform. If you do not agree, you must not use the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                You represent that you are at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of a business entity, you represent that you are authorized to bind that entity.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Description of Services & Our Role</h2>
            <p>
                Saloon Book acts solely as an intermediary technology platform facilitating connections between Users and independent Vendors. We do <strong>not</strong>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide, own, control, supervise, manage, or operate any salon services</li>
                <li>Employ, engage, or supervise Vendors (they are independent contractors)</li>
                <li>Endorse the quality, timeliness, safety, or legality of any Vendor services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The contract for services is formed directly between you (the User) and the Vendor at the time of booking. We are not a party to that contract and bear no responsibility for the performance, quality, or outcome of the booked services.
            </p>

            <h2>3. User Accounts & Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>
                To use certain features, you must create an account with accurate information. You are responsible for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials</li>
                <li>All activities occurring under your account</li>
                <li>Providing truthful, current, and complete information during registration and booking</li>
                <li>Updating your information as necessary</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You agree not to: impersonate others, use the Services for unlawful purposes, interfere with the Platform, post harmful content, or attempt unauthorized access.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Bookings, Payments & Fees</h2>
            <p>
                Bookings are subject to Vendor availability and confirmation. Prices displayed are set by Vendors (we may add platform convenience fees, taxes, or payment processing charges, which are disclosed before checkout).
            </p>
            <p>
                Payments are processed via third-party PCI-DSS compliant gateways. We do not store full payment card details. By making a payment, you authorize us to facilitate the transaction on behalf of the Vendor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Platform fees (if any) are non-refundable except as required by law. Vendors may charge additional fees (e.g., for add-ons) directly.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Cancellations, No-Shows & Refunds</h2>
            <p>
                Cancellation and refund policies are determined by individual Vendors and displayed during booking. You must comply with the Vendor's policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                We facilitate refunds only as per Vendor instructions or when required under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 and E-Commerce Rules. Disputes regarding service quality, no-shows, or refunds are primarily between you and the Vendor. We may assist in mediation but are not obligated to resolve disputes or issue refunds from our funds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeated no-shows or abusive cancellation behavior may result in account restrictions or suspension.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Vendor Obligations & Independence</h2>
            <p>
                Vendors are independent service providers and not our employees, agents, or partners. They are solely responsible for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses, registrations, insurance, and compliance with applicable laws (including Shops and Establishments Act, GST, health & safety regulations)</li>
                <li>Delivering services with due care, skill, and professionalism</li>
                <li>Complying with their own cancellation/refund policies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We reserve the right (but have no obligation) to remove Vendors who receive consistent negative feedback or violate our policies.
            </p>

            <h2>7. User Conduct & Reviews</h2>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Reviews must be honest, relevant, and not contain abusive, defamatory, or unlawful content. We may remove or edit reviews at our discretion.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
